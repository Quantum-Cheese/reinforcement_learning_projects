## Introduction

Using (deep) reinforcement_learning algorithm to practice on OpenAI Gym, Unity ML-Agents,and other virtual environments. 

For more information about OpenAI Gym environment, see: <https://github.com/openai/gym>

### 1. Acrobot

A Reinforcement Learning project running on OpenAI gym environment: [Acrobot-v1 ](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Acrobot-v1)

Using tile coding to solve the  continuous state space, and them perform the original Q-Learning algorithm to it.

### 2. MountCar

A Reinforcement Learning project running on OpenAI gym enviroment: MountainCarContinuous v0.  

Using discretization to generalize the Q-Learning algorithm to continuous space. 

### 3. Pro_BlackJack

An implementation of  Monte Carlo controlling algorithms  to solve the  OpenAI gym environment:Blackjack*-v0. 

### 4.Pro_LunarLander

An implementation of deep reinforcement learning algorithm—DQN， except for the original DQN form, I also tried several improved architecture, including double DQN,  Prioritized Experience Replay, and the dueling DQN. I use Pytorch to  build the neural network for my agent.

the environment I use to experiment  the DQN agent is [LunarLander-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2)

### 5. MountCar_continuous

Using mutiple approaches to solve the gym  MountainCarContinuous v0 <https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/MountainCarContinuous-v0>
